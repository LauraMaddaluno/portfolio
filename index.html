      <p id="motivations">I am a web developer self taught student with creative and logical thinking skills.
         I have spent the last year teaching myself to code because I want to improve people's lives through technology.
          A bootcamp will enhance my skills and provide me with tools to become a qualified software developer.

        I am determined to find solutions to the challenges I face, both in life and coding. 
        This makes me feel fulfilled and pushes me to continually improve myself.
        For example I was able to balance my duties as a full - time mom of a 3 years old with my learning schedule, 
        as a result of which I built my first projects in HTML, CSS, JS using resources like Udemy, freeCodeCamp, codebar and Codecademy.
        In order to approach backend development, I started learning Ruby. I am a regular student of codebar’s pair programming workshops
        and I am an active member of that community, volunteering as a coach and being a moderator during the last Codebar Festival event. 
        My singing profession has fine-tuned my transferable skills of communication, self-motivation, working under stressful situations and teamwork.
        As a team leader between 2008 and 2011, I led a diverse group of singers, musicians and event managers to produce a 
        successful yearly event that attracted larger audiences each year. 
        The performance was enjoyed by each audience and  was  fulfilling for the musicians.
        My aim is the same for coding, I adore the idea that people can interact with what I have created and, 
        even better, they can use it.
        My mindset is based on rules and logical thinking, thanks to my studies in mathematics, 
        Latin and ancient Greek. These skills, combined with my calm, confident and reassuring personality,
        have meant that I have helped my students with different learning styles to achieve excellent results. 
        My perseverance and attention to detail helped my pupils to improve on their learning styles and 
        the majority of them achieved an A score especially in mathematics.
        I am resilient and reflective, and rather than waiting for perfection, 
        I use what I have and what I know to produce the best possible results in a given situation. 
        I am aware that not everything can be solved in a particular way,  
        and so I am an attentive listener and a sympathetic person who considers carefully all advice that is given
        
        I’m looking for an environment where self-learning is encouraged, 
        but  also where  structured and professional guidance is available.
        For these reasons I think Boolean is a tangible opportunity for me to make a final leap 
        and start a career in the tech industry.

      <p class="singertext">Since I was a child, I had a passion for singing and my neighborhood can confirm it...
        I remember taking my broom and doing my show on my grandma's balcony...
        Then I grew up and started taking singing lessons. After getting my high school diploma, I decided to apply for a masters degree in singing at Conservatorio D. Cimarosa in Avellino.
        I've done several concerts, some Operas, and also coached the Neapolitan language of Don Pomponio, a buffo character in Rossini's opera La Gazzetta, for The Royal College of Music, in London.
        I had such a great time... now what?
        Well now my life has changed and I decided to change career as well.
        <!-- So I started to wonder what I could do and searched online for a job that I could do without an expensive qualification or minimum age requirements.
        So... here I am, building my very first web page and enjoying every single moment of it, even when I almost had a heart attack because of a missing closing curly bracket in my CSS file...
        Before doing this project, I learned basic HTML and CSS.
        But I was more focused on JavaScript which I fell in love with at first sight because of the possibility to solve problems and let the computer do all the boring and hard work.
        I then discovered CSS3 animations and started to imagine how and where I could use them, hence my web page along with my desire to acquire more knowledge. -->

      <h1>Why I applied</h1>
      <p>
        When I decided to follow the coding route, I really didn't know anything about it.
So I bought a course on Udemy and started to attend Codebar's meet-ups in London on a regular basis.
There I've met several Founders and Coders students and I was always very impressed about how much they knew and how confident they were.
All of them were very happy about their experiences. So I thought that FAC could be the best opportunity for me.
When I completed the expression of interest and went to weekly meetings, I felt more and more excited about coding and about FAC, especially when I attended the presentation of the previous cohort Tech for Better programme projects.

It literally blew my mind and I was thrilled about the idea that in a few months time, I could achieve what they have achieved.

I really love the idea of an inclusive and diverse environment where you don't have to impress  or struggle to be appreciated but where you can feel you are part of a team fulfilling the same purpose: learn from each other and build something that makes a positive impact on people's lives.
